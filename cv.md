## About myself:
My career in the banking sector began in 2013 as a credit agent and ended in 2020 as a back office specialist for supporting transactions of individuals.

Now I'm studying Frontend development.

I choose this profession because I like to solve logical tasks, creating something new and see the result of my work.
************
## Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS3 (in progress)
* JavaScript (in progress)
* Git, GitHub (in progress)
**************
## Code example:
**Multiple 3 or 5.** **KATA from CODEWARS:** *If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.*

*Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).*

*Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.*

```
function solution(number) {
  let sum = 0;
  if (number < 0) {
    sum;
  } else {
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
      if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
        sum += i;
      }
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(solution(25));
```
